# AGENTS.md

## Project memory
This repo uses a lightweight session memory file at `docs/SESSION.md`.

## How to resume quickly
1) Open `docs/SESSION.md` and read **Status**, **Next steps**, and **Notes**.
2) Check recent changes with `git status` and `git log -5 --oneline`.
3) Continue from **Next steps**.

## How to update at session end
Update `docs/SESSION.md` with:
- What changed (files/areas)
- What is next (ordered)
- Any blockers, commands, or env notes

Keep it short and concrete.
